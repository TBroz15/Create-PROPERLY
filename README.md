A vanilla+ modpack, centered on Create 6, with everything necessary such as QOL and Optimization Mods. Nothing less, nothing more, just proper!

## Why?

## Motivation

Viewers from [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TBroz15) asked with THOUSANDS of comments asked for the mod's name, how to install it, how to get any Create-themed modpack, and whatever nonsense. So I made a dedicated modpack to simplify everything and make sure it is stable, simple, and PROPER as much as possible, while adding more aspects.
