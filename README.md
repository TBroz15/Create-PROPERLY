A Create Mod 6 minimalist modpack, with everything necessary such as QOL and Optimization Mods. Nothing less, nothing more, just proper!

<!--TODO: Add this when the vid is released-->
<!--#### Click me, if you want a tutorial on how to install this modpack PROPERLY-->

## Why?

Because modpacks should've been PROPERLY PROPER from the start. This modpack was designed to give you a lightweight, optimized, simple, and PROPER Create Mod experience while improving the gameplay with QOL and some Vanilla+ mods!

## "So what made this modpack special?"

- Has Create 6.0.6 with Addons (soon to update to 6.0.8+ if everything is stable)
- Has 1.21 features backported
- Can run under 2GB allocated RAM! (recommended to use 4GB)
- Is heavily optimized
- Has less than 100 mods
- Has good shader support (Oculus + Colorwheel + CreateBetterFPS)
- Can run Fabric Mods (via Sinytra Connector)

## Motivation

Viewers from [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TBroz15) asked me with THOUSANDS of comments for the mod's name, how to install it, how to get any Create-themed modpack, and for whatever nonsense. So I made a dedicated modpack to simplify everything and make sure it is stable, simple, and PROPER as much as possible, while adding more aspects to the game.

## "I want to make a modpack like this one!"

Good news! This modpack is [open-sourced](https://github.com/TBroz15/Create-PROPERLY) and built with [Packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/), meaning you can tweak, remix, create, and publish your own flavor.

## "But wait a minute, is it actually PROPER?"

If you say 100% PROPER, of course not, as there is no such thing as a PROPER modpack. It is up to the players like you to pick what's best. But for me, this a good modpack for Create Mod beginners and people with low end devices.

###### mod name?
